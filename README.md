# JSON Utilities Powershell Module

## Description

Module contains following Cmdlets

- `Get-JsonDifference` - Obtains differences between two JSON objects and produces JSON string with the following JSON object keys:

  - Added - items that were not present in FromJsonString and are now in ToJsonString JSON object.
  - Changed - items that were present in FromJsonString and in ToJsonString containing new values are from ToJsonString JSON object.
  - ChangedOriginals - - items that were present in FromJsonString and in ToJsonString containing old values are from FromJsonString JSON object.
  - Removed - items that were present in FromJsonString and are missing in ToJsonString JSON object.
  - NotChanged - items that are present in FromJsonString and in ToJsonString JSON objects with the same values.
  - New - Merged Added and Changed resulting objects representing all items that have changed and were added.

- `ConvertTo-KeysSortedJSONString` - Sorts JSON object by keys

## Target system

Was written to work on Windows PowerShell 5.1, but it also work with PowerShell 6/7 on other platforms

## **Limitations**

1. Arrays sub-objects are compared literally as strings after every object within array is sorted by keys and whole array is minified afterwards.

2. Due to limitation of ConvertTo-Json in PowerShell 5.1 <https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/3705> object with case sensitive keys are not supported. E.g. Can't have object with `KeyName` and `keyname`.

## Install

Available in PSGallery: [https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/JsonUtils](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/JsonUtils)

```powershell
Install-Module -Name JsonUtils -Scope CurrentUser
```

## Roadmap

2022-07-01 Szeraax-

I want to work this module towards a v1.0 release. I plan to make a full code review of the module to improve readability and improve performance. Stuff like using objects and `Add-Member` is generally quite inefficient.

It is likely that I will change at least 1 function name. I may change some parameter names. If I do, I will deprecate and add warning message, without breaking changes unless absolutely needed (unlikely).

Stay tuned!

### `Get-JsonDifference`

```powershell
Get-Help Get-JsonDifference -Full
```

```text
NAME
    Get-JsonDifference

SYNOPSIS
    Compares two JSON strings and generated stringified JSON object representing differences.

    LIMITATIONS:
        1. Arrays sub-objects are compared literally as strings after every object within array is sorted by keys and
            whole array is minified afterwards.

        2. Due to limitation of ConvertTo-Json in PowerShell 5.1 <https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/3705>
            object with case sensitive keys are not supported. E.g. Can't have object with `KeyName` and `keyname`.

    Get-JsonDifference [-FromJsonString] <String> [-ToJsonString] <String> [[-Depth] <String>] [-Compress] [<CommonParameters>]


DESCRIPTION


PARAMETERS
    -FromJsonString <String>
        Old variant of stringified JSON object.

        Required?                    true
        Position?                    1
        Default value
        Accept pipeline input?       false
        Accept wildcard characters?  false

    -ToJsonString <String>

    -Depth <String>
        Depth used on resulting object conversion to JSON string ('ConvertTo-Json -Depth' parameter).
        Is it also used when converting Array values into JSON string after it has been sorted for comparison logic.

        Accept wildcard characters?  false

    -Compress [<SwitchParameter>]
        Set to minify resulting object

        Required?                    false
        Position?                    named
        Default value                False
        Accept pipeline input?       false
        Accept wildcard characters?  false

    <CommonParameters>
        This cmdlet supports the common parameters: Verbose, Debug,
        ErrorAction, ErrorVariable, WarningAction, WarningVariable,
        OutBuffer, PipelineVariable, and OutVariable. For more information, see
        about_CommonParameters (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216).

INPUTS

OUTPUTS
    JSON string with the following JSON object keys:

    - Changed - items that were present in FromJsonString and in ToJsonString containing new values are from ToJsonString JSON object.
    - ChangedOriginals - - items that were present in FromJsonString and in ToJsonString containing old values are from FromJsonString JSON object.
    - Removed - items that were present in FromJsonString and are missing in ToJsonString JSON object.
    - NotChanged - items that are present in FromJsonString and in ToJsonString JSON objects with the same values.
    - New - Merged Added and Changed resulting objects representing all items that have changed and were added.
